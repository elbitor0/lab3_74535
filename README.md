Final Project Mobile Dev

I haven't been able to achieve this project very well, only the signin part actually work, I am not able to do the rest.
You can see on my github that even though almost nothing work, I atleast tried. I spent a lot of time trying to apply tutorial on these project but it didn't lead to anything. I couldn't make a video for this because there is basically not a lot of thing to show. What I have learnt on this project is that I must start this kind of project as soon as possible because else cannot make It on time, I also learnt that documentation is preferable to tutorial because youtube tutorial often make things too hard and it is not easy to adapt to another project.
